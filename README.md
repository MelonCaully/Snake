## How to Play
If you want to take a gander at the game and mess around with the files you can clone
the repository and run build_run.bat in the root of the project. This will compile
the game into an executable in the 'Debug' folder inside 'build' where you can then
run it. Most settings for the game will be in GameConfig.hpp if you want to modify to
your liking.
